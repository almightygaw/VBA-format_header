# VBA-format_header
Excel VBA makes imported data easier to read and analyze

This repository is a combination of VBA I found through extensive Googling and my own work. This VBA macro is useful upon importing data from a .csv or .txt file. It formats and freezes the header row, sets autofit column width, and standardizes font in order to make the data easier to read. I would recommend assigning this macro to your PERSONAL.XLS workbook and assigning a keyboard shortcut.

This macro assumes that your data has one row (top row) as its header. In its current state, it will not work for multiple-row headers (although that can be customized, depending on your needs).
